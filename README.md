# Fake-Battery
## An Android app that allows you to change your battery percentage (root required)

# What is this app for?
This app is for when your friends want to steal your charger but you don't want to give it to them, so just set the battery to 4 to show that it still needs to charge

# And to show the normal percentage?
Just reboot the phone!

# How to compile
To compile this app, just open this project on Android Studio and compile it

# Please if there are bugs write it on issue!
### Yes I know this code is very messy but it's my first Android app! Excuse me!
